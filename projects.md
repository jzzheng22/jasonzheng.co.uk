    title: ISSIE Drawing Library • High Level Programming
    content: >-
      * Used **F#** and the Elmish MVU framework to develop a replacement for the Draw2D JavaScript library to be used in ISSIE.

      * The drawing library is responsible for drawing electronic schematics in ISSIE.

      * Acted as Team Lead for the project, reviewing Pull Requests and ensuring we met deadlines and deliverables.

      * [Find the source code here.](https://github.com/jzzheng22/hlp21-project-group-3)

      * Completed as part of the ELEC96019 - High Level Programming (functional programming) course in 2021.

    title: Music Synthesiser • Embedded Systems
    content: >-
      * Developed firmware loaded onto an **Arduino** for a keyboard music synthesiser.

      * Core functions include using multi-threaded programming to detect simultaneous    
        keypresses, play the correct frequency, display a user interface, and communicate as an IoT device.
      * Advanced features include playing different timbres, changing octaves, and  
        implementing polyphony (being able to play multiple notes simultaneously).
      * Source code available on request.

      * Completed as part of the ELEC96018 - Embedded Systems course in 2021.

    title: CPsmaRt • Embedded Systems
    content: >-
      * Designed a IoT-capable CPR training device using a Raspberry Pi, load cell, magnetometer, and accelerometer.

      * Used **Python** to communicate with hardware, and displayed the data using a 
        **Flask** webpage.
      * Source code available on request.

      * Completed as part of the ELEC96018 - Embedded Systems course in 2021.

    title: Program Optimisation • Advanced Computer Architecture
    content: >-
      * Optimised performance of a C++ implementation of Gaussian Belief Propagation.

      * Assessed performance and investigated bottlenecks using Intel VTune Profiler.

      * Used multi-threading, improved memory management and cached iterators to improve
        execution time by 33%.
      * Completed as part of the COMP60001 - Advanced Computer Architecture course in 2020.

    title: Microarchitectural Optimisation • Advanced Computer Architecture
    content: >-
      * Used the SimpleScalar processor microarchitecture simulator to investigate the effects of microarchitecture changes on the energy consumption of a processor running the Smith-Waterman algorithm.

      * Optimised the processor's microarchitectural features to minimise energy consumption, achieving a reduction of 45%.

      * Completed as part of the COMP60001 - Advanced Computer Architecture course in 2020.

    title: A Pigment of Your Imagination • Oxford Hack 2019
    content: >-
      * Created an Android app in **Kotlin** and **Java** that turns photos into blank 
        colouring stencils.
      * Implemented edge detection algorithm and scanline fill algorithms to find shape 
        outlines and fill colours within these lines.
      * Finalist for Most Stylish Hack.

    title: Composed • IC Hack 2020
    content: >-
      * Designed and implemented a program to convert monophonic audio files into sheet 
        music by analysing their frequency components.
      * Used a Fast Fourier Transform algorithm to convert audio from time domain to 
        frequency domain.

    title: C to MIPS Compiler • EIE2 Language Processors
    content: >-
      * Wrote a compiler in **C++** to generate MIPS assembly from a subset of 
        pre-processed C90 code.
      * Wrote a transspiler to translate a subset of C into equivalent Python.
      
      * Used Flex and Yacc to implement lexing and parsing functionality.

    title: MIPS CPU Simulator • EIE2 Computer Architecture
    content: >-
      * Developed a CPU simulator in **C++** to executed MIPS-1 big-endian binaries, and 
        created a testbench to verify the correctness of the simulator.
      * Referenced the MIPS ISA specification to ensure parity between emulated   
        instructions and real hardware.

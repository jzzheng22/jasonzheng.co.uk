    content: >-
      Hi! I'm Jason. Originally from Auckland, New Zealand, I moved to London in September 
      2018 where I'm currently studying for an MEng Electronic and Information 
      Engineering at Imperial College London.


      I have a special interest in computer architecture, with experience in embedded 
      systems, functional programming and machine learning.


      When I'm not studying, I can be found playing the clarinet or the piano.

      I've worked on quite a few varied projects, both in and outside of my studies. My experience ranges high level functional programming, to embedded multi-threaded programming, right down to microarchitectural optimisations.

      Currently I'm Part-Time Undergraduate at Arm, where I'm working on some extensions for Compiler Explorer. I've also been contributing to 
      some open-source tooling, including Clang and the SPIR-V/LLVM Translator.


      I also work for Imperial College London as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant and a
      STEM Outreach Ambassador. My work at Imperial ranges from teaching programming to first-years and working at Outreach events, mentoring school students and providing
      information about Imperial to prospective applicants.


      In my spare time, I do volunteer work with the Imperial College Union, where 
      I'm helping to advocate for students, run societies, and promote diversity and 
      inclusion for minority groups.
